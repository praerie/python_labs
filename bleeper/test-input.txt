Beep boop, this is a test!
Some four-letter words: leaf, warm, nook, safe, cozy
What if a four-letter word is at the start of a sentence or is followed by punctuation? Love is all you need.
A four-letter contraction like "don't" should be censored.
Words in quotes, like "boat", should be censored too.
Short (a, an) and long (exceedingly) words should remain unchanged.
Numbers like 1234 and mixed words like a1b2 should not be censored.
